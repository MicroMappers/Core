                <p><strong>Hi!</strong> Many thanks for volunteering your time as a digital humanitarian. Disaster responders need to know the extent of the damage and resulting needs. This critical information is often captured by videos shared on Twitter in real time, which is where you come in.
               </p>
                <p>Please note that a small number of videos displayed may show injured individuals, so only press next and volunteer if you are aware of this and still wish to help. Thank you.</p>

                <p>Being a Digital Humanitarian Volunteer is as easy and fast as a click of the mouse. This app will simply load a video and ask you to click on which category best describes the damage captured in the video.</p>
                <p>There are 2 possible choices:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><i class="icon-severe"></i> Severe Damage:</strong> Video shows severe damage, leveled buildings, major infrastructure damage, destroyed vehicles, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong><i class="icon-mild"></i> Mild Damage:</strong>  Video shows mild damage, broken windows, felled trees, damaged vehicles, minor infrastructure damage. </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Since one video may show several scenes of damage, simply click on the corresponding category when every time you do see damage and continue watching the video until the end. Once the video ends, the Clicker will automatically load the next video. You can also skip directly to the next video by clicking on the green circle titled Next.</p>
                <p>That's all there is to it. If you want to keep track of your progress, make sure to login.</p>
                <p>Thanks again for helping out!</p>
