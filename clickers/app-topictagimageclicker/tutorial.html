                <p><strong>Hi!</strong> Many thanks for volunteering your time as a digital humanitarian. Disaster responders need to know the extent of the damage and resulting needs. This critical information is often captured by pictures shared on Twitter in real time, which is where you come in.
               </p>
                <p>Please note that a small number of pictures may be disturbing to look at, so only proceed with the Clicker if you are prepared for this. Thank you.</p>

                <p>Being a Digital Humanitarian Volunteer is as easy and fast as a click of the mouse. This app will simply load a picture and ask you to click on which category best describes the damage captured in the picture.</p>
                <p>The categories are:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><i class="icon-none"></i> No damage (Green):</strong> Either the picture shows an area with no damage at all, or the picture is irrelevant or unrelated.</li>
                    <li><strong><i class="icon-mild"></i> Mild Damage (Orange):</strong> Picture shows mild damage, broken windows, felled trees, damaged vehicles, minor infrastructure damage.</li>
                    <li><strong><i class="icon-severe"></i> Severe Damage (Red):</strong> Picture shows severe damage, leveled buildings, major infrastructure damage, destroyed vehicles, etc.</li>

                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>You can also use your keyboard to enter responses:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong><i class="icon-none"></i> No damage:</strong> '1'</li>
                        <li><strong><i class="icon-mild"></i> Mild Damage:</strong> '2' </li>
                        <li><strong><i class="icon-severe"></i> Severe Damage:</strong> '3'</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Each Image will be viewed by different users until 3 of those users agree on the same answer. For this reason, if you are unsure of which answer is correct, make your best guess and move on to the next one.</p>
                <p>That's all there is to it. As soon as you click on one of the three choices, you will be shown the next picture. If you want to keep track of your progress, make sure to login.</p>
