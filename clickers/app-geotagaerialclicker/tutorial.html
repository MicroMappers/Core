                    Rangers at Kuzikus Wildlife Reserve need your help to find wild animals in their reserve. This will enable our ranger friends to better protect these beautiful animals from poachers and other threats.

                    According to the rangers, "Rhino poaching continues to be a growing problem that threatens to extinguish some rhino species within a decade or two. Rhino monitoring is thus important for their protection. Using digital maps in combination with MicroMappers to trace aerial images of rhinos could greatly improve rhino monitoring efforts."

                    <b>Our shields strategy has changed, so please read carefully.</b>
                    <p>
                        We'll use the "Aerial Clicker" to search for wildlife in aerial photographs of the Kuzikus Reserve. In this mini tutorial, we'll show you how to draw "digital shields" around the animals you find. But first, here are examples of helpful shields (versus unhelpful ones):
                    </p><br>
                    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/C7xDBrf.png" width="500" height="301">
                    <br><br><p>
                        The white outlines are the shields that we drew using the Aerial Clicker above. Notice that our shields include the shadows of the animals, this important. If the animals are close to each other, the shields can overlap but there can only be one shield per animal (one shield per rhino in this case : )
                    </p><br>
                    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/QCOO7Go.png" width="500" height="303">
                    <br><br><p>These shields are too close to the animals, please give them more room!</p>
                    <br>
                    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/i9imoEu.png" width="500" height="302">
                    <br><br><p>
                        These shields are too big.</p>
                    <br><p>
                        If you’ve found something that may be an animal but you’re not sure, then please draw a shield anyway just in case. Don’t worry if most pictures don’t have any animals. Knowing where the animals are not is just as important as knowing where they are!
                    </p>
                    <br><p>
                        This looks like a giraffe! So lets draw a shield.
                    </p><br>
                    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/mssT8mE.png" width="500" height="302">
                    <br><br><p>
                        This shield does not include the giraffe’s shadow! So lets try again.</p><br>
                    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/EjuIsHb.png" width="500" height="302">
                    <br><br><p>
                        This shield is too large. Lets try again!</p><br>
                    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/HHcj7n6.png" width="500" height="302">
                    <br><br><p>
                        Now that’s perfect!</p>

                <p>
                    <p>Here are some more pictures of animals that we'll be looking for. As a digital ranger, you'll simply need to draw shields around these animals, that's all there is to it. The shields can overlap if need be, but remember: one shield per animal, include their shadows and give them some room to move around : )
                    </p><br>

                        Can you spot the ostriches? Click picture above to enlarge. You'll be abel to zoom in with the Aerial Clicker during the Wildlife Challenge.
                    </p><br>

                    <br><br><p>
                        Can you spot the five oryxes in the above? Actually, there may be a 6th one in the shadows, can you spot it?
                    </p><br>

                        And the impalas in the left of the picture? Again, you'll be able zoom in with the Aerial Clicker.

                <p><p>Some final tips before your expedition!</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you create a profile (click on Community above), you'll be able to keep track of your clicks and accumulate do-good points.</li>
                        <li>Note that you can use the "+" and "-" buttons to zoom in for a closer look and to pan out. </li>
                        <li>Don't worry if you don't see many animals! Knowing where there are no animals is just as important to the rangers in Namibia. If you're not sure whether what you see is an animal, draw a shield anyway just in case!</li>
                        <li>If you have any questions during the expedition or simply want to hang out with fellow digital rangers, we have our own <a href="http://www.chatzy.com/84051188846467" target="_blank">chat room here</a>.</li>
                        <li>This expedition has two goals: (1) to look for wild animals, and (2) to test this new "Aerial Clicker" before we actually use it in response to a humanitarian disaster. This means that the tool is not perfect. We're doing this pilot so we can test and improve the Clicker. So thank you very much for your patience if the Clicker does not (yet) work as well as we'd like. Your feedback is super important for future humanitarian applications, so feel free to share your <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qVBvc1iH3W1_KAwVPq5ZmymO9ToStLqbnR7hvoM_qHU/viewform" target="_blank">suggestions here</a>.
