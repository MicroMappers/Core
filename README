MicroMappers was developed by QCRI & researchers & volunteer developers around the world.  

About the Project 

MicroMappers is a collection of websites or Clickers (beta version). Each Clicker is designed to easily tag different types of information. 
There are clicker instances for Tweets, Images, Video, Geo and Aerial Imagery. We are also in the early stages of on a Translation Clicker.
